## How to install

### Windows
You can install using the installer from the [releases](https://github.com/mas6y6/CipherOS/releases), or you can download everything from the [dist](https://github.com/mas6y6/CipherOS/tree/main/dist) folder if you want to do that thats your choice.

### macOS
The macOS downloads are coming soon you can just use the [compile.sh](https://github.com/mas6y6/CipherOS/blob/main/compile.sh) the directory structure should cipher should something like this:
```tree
.
├── cipher
│   ├── plugins.py
│   ├── argumentparser.py
│   ├── icon.ico
│   ├── api.py
│   ├── network.py
│   └── exceptions.py
└── main.py
```
**The `cipher` folder must be in the SAME folder as the executeable!**

### Linux
For linux users you can just compile it yourself because not all linux executeables work the same as others.
The instructions are the same as the macOS but I am still going to write it for you lazy people XD
