An hacknet inspired hacking program

## How to install

### Windows
You can use the standalone .exe from [releases](https://github.com/mas6y6/CipherOS/releases), or you can clone the repository locally and use [pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/)

Note: the standalone .exe will generate the `plugins` and `data` folder in the directory that the executable is run in, so it is recommended to drop the .exe in a dedicated folder before running.

### macOS
The macOS downloads are coming soon you can just use the [compile.sh](https://github.com/mas6y6/CipherOS/blob/main/compile.sh) the directory structure should cipher should something like this:
```tree
.
├── cipher
│   ├── plugins.py
│   ├── argumentparser.py
│   ├── icon.ico
│   ├── api.py
│   ├── network.py
│   └── exceptions.py
└── main.py
```
**The `cipher` folder must be in the SAME folder as the executeable!**

### Linux
For linux users you can just compile it yourself because not all linux executeables work the same as others.
The instructions are the same as the macOS but I am still going to write it for you lazy people XD
