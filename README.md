An hacknet inspired hacking program

## How to install

### Windows
You can use the standalone .exe from [releases](https://github.com/mas6y6/CipherOS/releases), or you can clone the repository locally and use [pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) with `compile.bat`

Note: the standalone .exe will generate the `plugins` and `data` folder in the directory that the executable is run in, so it is recommended to drop the .exe in a dedicated folder before running.

### macOS / Linux
The downloads are coming soon.
For now you can just use the [compile.sh](https://github.com/mas6y6/CipherOS/blob/main/compile.sh) to compile the `main.py` file to `cipher`.

And download the cipher folder and put it in the same directory as `cipher`
```tree
.
├── cipher
│   ├── plugins.py
│   ├── argumentparser.py
│   ├── icon.ico
│   ├── api.py
│   ├── network.py
│   └── exceptions.py
└── cipher (This is an executeable)
```
**The `cipher` folder must be in the SAME folder as the executeable!**
